The JSAPI Console is designed to allow developers to try various different calls against the JSAPI without having to post the pages to a server.  

<h2>Examples</h2>
There are a variety of existing examples under several categories.  You can view the default behavior by clicking on the item in the list - but the great thing is that you can edit the code in the code window and click "Run" and see how the result changes.  You can always revert to the default code for that example by clicking "Clean Up".

Whenever an example is chosen, a green box appears at the top right of the window.  This box has a tinyurl which will link directly to the example you're viewing.  You can use this to share the link using your favorite social network, or link directly to the example from a document or blog.

<h2>Framework</h2>
The Framework tab allows you to use a different set of examples for your particular use.  To set up a new framework, input the URL for the framework and your API key.  Your preferences will be saved in a cookie for future visits.  By default, each page will show a "Sign in with LinkedIn" button, but you can change this by de-selecting the "Session Buttons" checkbox.

You can add to the Parameters box to send additional parameters when loading examples.
